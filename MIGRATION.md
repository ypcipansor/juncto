# Juncto Migration Gap Matrix

Gap matrix for the React Ôćĺ Rust (Leptos + Axum) migration. Status values:

- **migrated** ÔÇö feature is implemented in the workspace root and exercised end-to-end.
- **partial** ÔÇö exists in the workspace root but with reduced function; noted under Reason.
- **missing** ÔÇö not yet implemented in the workspace root.
- **skip** ÔÇö deliberately excluded; the Reason column must justify.

Mobile (`react/features/mobile/`, `ios/`, `android/`) is out of scope per user decision and is not listed.

## Health baseline (Step 0 audit)

- `bash build.sh`: Ôťů succeeds (WASM + bindings generated, backend serves `:3000`).
- `cargo test --workspace`: Ôťů green ÔÇö 101 tests (29 + 48 + 24 across three crates).
- Playwright suite `tests/e2e`: Ôťů **88 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed** (~2.4m, chromium), incl. `screenshot-gallery.spec.ts` capturing 10 UI views to `tests/screenshots/`. `tests/e2e/` duplication removed in Step 7.

| dial-in (dial-in) | partial | `components_ui/dial_in.rs` static info; SIP not possible. |
| transcribing | skip | Would need STT backend (Jigasi/Vosk); React parity impossible. |

| unsupported-browser | migrated | `lib.rs` blocks when no WebRTC. |
| dynamic-branding | migrated | `state.set_branding`; `branding.spec.ts`. |

## external-api decision (Langkah 0(d))

- Current usage: embedded meetings via iframe only Ôćĺ skip public command/event bridge.
- Public API behavior: **not kept** ÔÇö the external JS API does not exist post-cutover; embedders use iframe embed (URL params) only.
- If future deployments require the bridge, Step 6 describes the `web-sys` postMessage implementation.

## Auth decision (Step 4)

- Anonymous joins remain the default and only mode, matching how the React client behaves for public deployments.
- `shared::Join.user_id` / `Participant { user_id }` stay as reserved fields; no session/JWT layer is added.
- Room-level security is enforced via lobby + lock + password (Step 4). Enterprise auth (JWT/JaaS-style) is out of scope, same as in the legacy React web client.

## Local spec consolidation (Langkah 7)

- Keep `tests/e2e/` (rich: full lifecycle, migration parity, UI verification).
- PNG artifacts retained under `verification*.png`; directory kept.

## Cutover status (Step 7)

- React web codebase, mobile apps (`android/`, `ios/`, `twa/`, `react-native-sdk/`), and
  server/packaging infrastructure (`debian/`, `doc/`, `resources/`, `Gemfile`) deleted.
- The Rust workspace previously under `rust-app/` was promoted to the repository root:
  `backend/`, `frontend/`, `shared/`, `tests/` and the root `Cargo.toml` / `build.sh`
  now form a single flat Rust workspace.
- CI runs Rust toolchain only (`.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml`), with no `rust-app/` paths.

## Exit criteria checklist

- [x] `cargo test` green, build green
- [x] One Playwright suite
- [x] Every migrated feature has parity (spec) or skip reason listed
- [x] React codebase removed (Step 7)
- [x] UI responsive verified at 480/768px (`responsive.spec.ts` green)
- [x] Mobile out of scope documented

## Verified broken/missing (Step 0 evidence)

1. `backend/static/styles.css` has exactly **1 @media** query (`@media (max-width: 768px)`, toolbox only).
2. `frontend/src/pages/room.rs` lines 164-170 compute inline `margin-right` = 320px ├Ś panel count ÔÇö replaced with CSS in Step 2.
3. `video_grid.rs` has all tile styles inline; no classes for filmstrip/thumbnails.
4. `ToggleRoomLock` exists (boolean); no password UI; is successive for Step 4.
5. E2EE toggle Ôćĺ `UpdateE2EE` exists; E2EEKeyExchange variant reserved; key-exchange flow deferred to Step 4.
6. `subtitles` overlay exists with "Transcriptions will appear here" stub; STT backend absent.
7. Two parallel Playwright suites (`tests/e2e/` + `tests/e2e/`) Ôćĺ keep `tests/e2e`.
