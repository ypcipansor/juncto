## Why Juncto

Juncto is an open-source video conferencing platform you can run yourself. The whole
stack &mdash; server, client and the wire types between them &mdash; is one Rust
workspace compiled to WebAssembly and a native binary. There is no JavaScript build
step, no separate SPA bundle to deploy, and no second language to keep in sync.

* **One language, one workspace.** The client, the server and the shared message types
  are Rust crates in the same repository.
* **No JS bundler.** The Leptos client is compiled to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and served
  straight from `frontend/pkg` by the Axum server.
* **Type-safe protocol.** Every WebSocket message is a `serde` enum in the `shared`
  crate, so a client and server mismatch is a compile error, not a runtime surprise.
* **Self-contained deployment.** A single binary plus a directory of static assets.

## Features

| Area | What you get |
|---|---|
| Conferencing | HD audio/video, WebRTC mesh, mute/camera controls, raise hand |
| Layout | Tile view, speaker view with spotlight, filmstrip thumbnails, picture-in-picture |
| Collaboration | Whiteboard, polls (create/active/history), shared document, Etherpad, shared video, GIF chat |
| Messaging | Public and private chat, typing indicators, chat history for late joiners, reactions |
| Sharing | Screen share, file sharing with chat attachments, local recording |
| Security | Room lock with optional password, lobby / waiting room, E2EE indicator, visitor mode |
| Personalisation | Virtual backgrounds, device selection, dynamic branding, noise suppression toggle |
| Accessibility | Keyboard shortcuts, i18n (EN/ID), audio-level and connection-quality indicators |
| Integrations | Calendar list, Salesforce panel, iframe embed code, static dial-in info |
| Rooms | Moderator controls, breakout rooms, remote control, speaker stats, analytics, presence |

Unsupported-browser detection and a rejoin overlay keep the experience predictable when a
network drops or WebRTC is unavailable.

## Screenshots

Every view below is captured automatically from the running application by
`tests/e2e/screenshot-gallery.spec.ts`. See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)
for how the gallery and the contrast audit work.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

* A Rust toolchain (stable, 1.75+) with the WebAssembly target:
  `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
* `wasm-bindgen-cli` at the version pinned in `Cargo.lock`
  (`cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli`)
* Node.js 18+ for the Playwright end-to-end suite
* On Linux, `pkg-config` and OpenSSL development headers
  (`apt-get install pkg-config libssl-dev`) so the host-side frontend build can link

### Build and run

```sh
bash build.sh                     # compile the WASM client into frontend/pkg
cargo run -p backend              # serve the app on http://localhost:3000
```

`build.sh` compiles the Leptos client for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, runs
`wasm-bindgen` to emit JS/WASM bindings into `frontend/pkg`, and copies
`frontend/index.html` next to them. The Axum server serves that directory plus
`backend/static`. Open `http://localhost:3000`, type a room name, and join.

The `Makefile` wraps the same steps:

```sh
make build        # same as bash build.sh
make test         # cargo test --workspace
make test-e2e     # build + npm ci + Playwright
make clean        # cargo clean
```

### Verify your change

Run everything from the repository root:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check                    # formatting
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings       # lints, warnings are errors
cargo test --workspace                        # 102 unit tests
cd tests/e2e && npx playwright test           # end-to-end parity + visual suite
```

The Playwright suite boots the real backend and captures screenshots to
`tests/screenshots/`, so a failing run also tells you whether the UI regressed visually.

| [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) | How to report a vulnerability |

## Configuration

The server listens on `0.0.0.0:3000`; that address is currently compiled in, so change it
in `backend/src/main.rs` and rebuild if you need a different port.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MOCK_AUTH_USER` | `admin` | Username accepted by the demo authentication dialog |
| `MOCK_AUTH_PASS` | `admin123` | Password accepted by the demo authentication dialog |

Static paths are resolved against `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`, so the binary serves the client
correctly no matter which directory you launch it from.

## Security

Room-level protection is available today: room lock with an optional password, a lobby
that requires host approval before anyone enters, visitor mode, and an E2EE status
indicator with per-participant key-exchange signalling.

For reporting vulnerabilities, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
