# Contributing to Juncto

Thanks for wanting to help. This page covers everything you need to get a change from an
idea to a merged pull request. The repository is a single Rust workspace — there is no
JavaScript source tree, only the Playwright suite under `tests/e2e`.

## Getting set up

Install the toolchain:

| Tool | Install |
|---|---|
| Rust (stable) | `curl --proto '=http' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` |
| WebAssembly target | `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` |
| `wasm-bindgen-cli` | `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli` (match the version in `Cargo.lock`) |
| Node.js 18+ | Your package manager, for the Playwright suite |
| `pkg-config` + OpenSSL headers | `apt-get install pkg-config libssl-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu |

Then build and run:

```sh
bash build.sh            # compile the WASM client into frontend/pkg
cargo run -p backend     # serve http://localhost:3000
```

[DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) goes deeper on the build loop, debugging and the
test suites.

## Before you open a pull request

Run all four from the repository root and make sure they pass:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check                 # formatting
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings    # lints; a warning fails the build
cargo test --workspace                     # 102 unit tests
cd tests/e2e && npx playwright test        # end-to-end suite
```

CI runs the same checks in a `checks` job followed by an `e2e` job, so a local pass means a
green build.

## What to work on

Good first contributions tend to be small and well-bounded:

* Fixing a bug with a reproduction in the issue.
* Adding a Playwright spec for behaviour that currently has none.
* Improving accessibility, contrast or responsive behaviour.
* Filling a gap listed as **partial** or **indicator-only** in
  [docs/FEATURES.md](./docs/FEATURES.md).

If you are planning something larger — a new protocol message, a change to the WebRTC
model, a new dependency — open an issue first so the approach can be agreed before you
write the code.

## Coding standards

### Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) with a scope:

```
feat(polls): add a history tab
fix(chat): replay history to late joiners
docs(readme): embed the screenshot gallery
```

Types in use: `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`,
`style`, `test`.

### Rust

* Formatting and lints are enforced (`cargo fmt`, `clippy -D warnings`).
* Add unit tests beside the code under `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`.
* Keep modules focused. Feature logic belongs in its own module under `frontend/src/` or
  `backend/src/handlers/`, not bolted onto `pages/room.rs` or `handlers/ws.rs`.
* The `shared` crate is the protocol contract. Adding a variant means handling it on both
  sides; let the compiler guide you.

### CSS

Style with the custom properties defined on `:root` in `backend/static/styles.css`
(`--bg-surface`, `--text-primary`, `--primary-color`, `--radius-*`, `--shadow-*`, …).
Literal colours inside a dialog are how the near-white-on-white bugs appeared; the contrast
audit will now fail the build for them.

### Tests

* Logic change → unit test.
* UI behaviour change → Playwright spec in `tests/e2e/`.
* New or changed screen → update `screenshot-gallery.spec.ts` and the README tables.
* CSS or dialog markup change → run `contrast-audit.spec.ts`.

Look at any screenshot you generate. A blank, white or unstyled capture is the specific
failure this tooling exists to catch: fix the UI, then regenerate.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Branch from `main` with a descriptive name (`fix/chat-history-replay`).
2. Keep the change focused. Unrelated refactors make review harder and are better as a
   separate pull request.
3. Fill in the pull request template, including which checks you ran.
4. Update documentation when behaviour, setup or features change — `README.md`,
   `docs/FEATURES.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` are the usual candidates.
5. Be responsive to review comments. If you disagree with feedback, say so with reasoning;
   that is a normal and useful part of the process.

## Reporting bugs

A useful bug report includes:

* What you did, what you expected, and what actually happened.
* The browser and version, and whether the server was built with `build.sh` at that commit.
* Browser console output — WASM load failures and WebSocket errors both surface there.
* A screenshot if the problem is visual. If you can, run
  `npx playwright test screenshot-gallery.spec.ts` and attach the relevant capture.
